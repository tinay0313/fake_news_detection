# Fake News Detection

The main goal of the project is to compare the performance and efficiency of different classifier models on fake news detection.

Additionally, the models were tested by training on one dataset and performing inference on another.

Please see the report for details regarding the models, methods, and results.

To run the project, first run the mergeData.py on the datasets that are to be trained on then run the cleanData.py to pre-process the text.
Then, run the models on the cleaned, labeled data to perform fake news detection.
